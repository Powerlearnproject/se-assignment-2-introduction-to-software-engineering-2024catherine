Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Phrase of the software Development Life cycles are 
a) Requirement is where you collects the useful infomation or reserach for certain software to develop , for example you can find the find problem of collecting tarrif in the marketing place and you want to solve this by developing a softaware suitable to the market. 
b) Design is where by all eserch and inofermation collected and structured the suitable software to fit in on the certain problem . By designing this software means creating the the package as per certain challenge of problen you find out on the requirement process
c) Implementation means you start to write codes for your design software 
d) Testing is the process of checking the software developed if its applicable and fit in . Example you cerate the codes on how to collcet tarrif in the marketing place by issuring all vendors register on the system and connect the online payment modes and align to the vendors number once the vendors paid the tarrif , the administation who oversee the collcetinion receive the notification the samme message to the vendors and these loca administartors process the tax receipt  and being collected to the collection area of the tax receipt . 
e) Deployment means realease that software to the customer or specific user to use the developed software . 
f) Maintanance due to the on going process of using and changing the customer preferance you have to provide the ongoing support on the developed software to the customer.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile models this is model based on long term projects while Waterfall models is the models based on shortterm project 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
                   COMPARISION BETWEEN AGILE AND WATEFALL MODELS 
Both Agile and Waterfall models are customer involment on the deveoplemt process , received feedback from the customer 
Both Agile and waterfalls models based on process flow where Iterative and incremental for Alige and Sequential and linear for waterfall models
Both Agile and Waterfalls models applied testing phrase before the deployment of the products to the customer. 

                  CONSTRACT BETWEEN AGILE AND WATERFALL MODELS
Agile modes is more flexible to apply on compare to the waterfalls models is not flexible 
Agile Models is adptable you can make changes on the ongoing project while Waterfalls models is less adaptable on making changes once the project is underway.
Agile Models lack of upfront planing that can lead to the project failure while Waterfall models have upronft planning have a minimum flexibiliy changes.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering is a systematic process of understanding, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a system or software application. Includes the following process 
a) Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, workshops, and other techniques.
b) Analysis: Examining the requirements to understand their completeness, consistency, feasibility, and testability.
c) Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner using natural language or formal specifications.
d) Validation: Ensuring that the requirements accurately reflect the stakeholder needs and are unambiguous.
e) Management: Maintaining traceability of requirements to ensure their implementation and tracking changes over time.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
          Modularity in software design means separating functionality of the program that allows complex software to be managable for the purpose of implementation and maintanance. It hepls in debugging . It improve the code quality by reducing cost and tme consuming. 
Easier debugging the Comprehensive test suites provide a clear and concise record of expected system behavior, making it easier to pinpoint the root cause of failures.
Reduced regression risk Automated tests act as a safety net, ensuring that changes to the system do not inadvertently break existing functionality.


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

.Unit Testing involves the mocking and dependanceInvolves mocking/stubbing dependencies and isolating the unit under test.

.Integration Testing means to Test how multiple modules interact with each other, Verifies the interfaces between components and ensures seamless data flow

.System Testing as complete system as a whole to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements that Involves black-box testing and end-to-end scenarios.

.Acceptance Testing - Tests the system from the user's perspective to ensure it meets their expectations and requirements, often involves user acceptance testing (UAT). 





What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
